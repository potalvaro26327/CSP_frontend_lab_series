   1. What new concept or skill did you learn in this lab?
   
   Let, Const, and how to use console.log to print values and data types.

   2. What challenges did you encounter, and how did you solve them?

The challenge I encountered was the code not appearing onto the console. I solved it by making sure I saved the file and ran the code properly.

   3. Where else could this programming concept be useful?

These programmibg concepts can be useful anywhere in coding since the things I learned are universal to all programming languages.

with an area of ${area} square units and a perimeter of ${perimeter} units.`);
